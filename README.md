# puppet-xldeploy_api
Puppet module with types and providers for xldeploy api
The need for this module came from the fact that is you have puppetservers for
every environment, you cannot use the exported resources from the xebia-puppet
module. So here we use the xldeploy curl api.

The goal is to provide several types for xldeploy:
- infrastructure
- environment
- more....

Any help is welcome
